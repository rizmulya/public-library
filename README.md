# public library

Built using my own PHP framework and Tailwind CSS

## Description:

- "Public Library" is a cool web app I made using my own PHP framework, kinda like CodeIgniter
- You can log in as different users - admins or regular peeps.
- There's a dashboard for admins and another one for the rest of us.
- I added smart search and smooth paging to find stuff super easy.
- Admins? They're the bosses. They can add, edit, and delete books, genres, users, and track book loans.
- People can borrow books, do checkouts, and even get neat PDF receipts.
- Oh, and there's a bonus: "Holy Quran" page. You can read the whole Quran, and it fetches data from a slick public API.


Login credentials:
Username and password are the same for all:
